# TypeMotion

Set type with LeapMotion gestures. I still don’t know why anyone would do this, but it’s kinda fun.

## The demo
The demo has a single paragraph that can be manipulated by motion gestures.

## Gestures

### Spin clockwise, one hand pointing, one hand un-clenched fist
Increases the font size

### Spin anti-clockwise, one hand pointing, one hand un-clenched fist
Reduces the font size

### Spin clockwise, one hand pointing, one hand clenched fist
Increases the line height

### Spin anti-clockwise, one hand pointing, one hand clenched fist
Reduces the line height

And that is all for now.

Go wild.
